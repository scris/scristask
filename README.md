### If you wanna copy it to your server or you find the task.scris.top server has ran out of flow
1. Fork the proj
2. Register an Leancloud account
3. Open signup/initLeanCloud.js
4. Make APPID & APPKEY your own.
5. If your Leancloud App is not in the US node, delete <code>region: 'us'</code>
6. Wait for some time, and you can use your own Scris Task.
